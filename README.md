## Overview

### The challenge

The goal of this project was to create a responsive contact form that collects user information, including their first name, last name, email, query type, and message. The form also includes a consent checkbox and validates user inputs, displaying error messages for invalid or missing inputs.

## My process

### Built with

- React
- CSS Flexbox
- Mobile-first workflow

### What I learned

In this project, I enhanced my skills in building responsive forms using React and CSS. I learned how to:

- Use state management with React's `useState` hook to handle form inputs and error messages.
- Implement form validation to ensure all required fields are filled out correctly.
- Create a responsive design that adjusts seamlessly to mobile screens using CSS media queries.

### Continued development

Future improvements for this project include:

- Adding more detailed form validation (e.g., checking email format).
- Implementing a backend to handle form submissions and send emails.
- Enhancing the user interface with more sophisticated styling and animations.

### Useful resources

- [React Documentation](https://reactjs.org/docs/getting-started.html) - Official React documentation.
- [CSS Tricks](https://css-tricks.com/) - Helpful articles and tutorials on CSS techniques.
